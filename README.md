### Multi-Environment CD Pipelines with AWS CodePipeline and OS Tools

In this Project, We will show how to deploy AWS infrastructure to multiple AWS accounts using open source tools and following best practices. We will explain a clear, simple, and repeatable deployment pipeline that can be used throughout multiple environments. The project we will create in this post will address a situation in which the customer needs to deploy an application to AWS into development, QA, and production environments. In addition in explaining how to configure the deployment pipeline, we will also cover how to arrange the AWS CloudFormation (https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) templates by function so that they can be deployed as a cohesive application stack.



### Motivation

A common scenario AWS customers face is how to automate their infrastructure deployments on AWS. Customers need to create a secure, agile workflow that deploys to the cloud and uses their preferred AWS services. Also, customers need a reliable, supportable deployment pattern driven by automated workflows that are not overly complex and difficult to manage. Customer organizations frequently seek the ability to hand off elements of their deployment patterns to different teams in their organizations. These requirements may seem daunting to these teams because they need time and training to get up-to-speed the on the technology they are being asked to support.

In this post, we will demonstrate how to reduce complexity and increase agility by creating a workflow geared toward operational support teams. By using this simplified deployment pattern, engineering teams will not be tied to supporting this solution. Rather, this solution can be used and supported by engineers and operational support folks throughout an organization. We also will show how to deploy AWS infrastructure to multiple AWS accounts using open source tools and following best practices. We will explain how to build a repeatable deployment pipeline that can be used throughout multiple environments.
